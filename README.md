Funtion game called ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS, computerPlay that will randomly return either 'Rock' or 'scissors' or 'paper'.
I create two players in this game: computerSelection and player selection.
Both players simultaneously forms one of the three shapes(rock, paper, scissors). 
The Outcome is a win or draw: Rock crushes scissors, paper covers rock, scissors cut paper.
if both players form the same shape, the game is tied and immediatly replay to break the tie.
